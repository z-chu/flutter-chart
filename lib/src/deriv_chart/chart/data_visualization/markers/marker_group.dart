/// Chart open position marker.
/// MarkerGroup is a container class that organizes related chart markers into a logical unit.
///
/// It serves as a grouping mechanism for ChartMarker objects that are related to each other
/// and should be treated as a cohesive unit on the chart. For example, a MarkerGroup might
/// represent all markers related to a specific trade or contract, such as entry points,
/// exit points, barriers, and ticks.
///
/// Each MarkerGroup has a specific type (e.g., "tick", "digit", "accumulator") that determines
/// how its markers are rendered on the chart. Different types of marker groups are rendered
/// by specialized MarkerGroupIconPainter implementations.
///
/// MarkerGroups can be sorted based on the epoch of their first marker, which is useful
/// for determining the order in which they should be displayed or processed.
///
/// The MarkerGroup class is used by MarkerGroupSeries to organize and display groups of
/// related markers on a chart. The MarkerGroupPainter class is responsible for painting
/// these marker groups on the canvas.
