/// Foundation class for painting marker group on canvas
/// An abstract base class for rendering groups of related markers on financial charts.
///
/// `MarkerGroupIconPainter` serves as a foundation for specialized painters that render
/// groups of related markers on a chart. It extends the `MarkerIconPainter` class,
/// which provides basic functionality for painting individual markers, and adds
/// specific functionality for painting groups of markers.
///
/// This class is part of a hierarchical design for marker visualization:
/// - `MarkerIconPainter` (parent): Base class for painting individual markers
/// - `MarkerGroupIconPainter` (this class): Abstract class for painting groups of markers
/// - Concrete implementations (children): Specialized painters for specific types of marker groups
///
/// Concrete implementations of this class include:
/// - `DigitMarkerIconPainter`: For rendering digit contract markers
/// - `TickMarkerIconPainter`: For rendering tick-based contract markers
/// - `AccumulatorMarkerIconPainter`: For rendering accumulator contract markers
///
/// The class works in conjunction with `MarkerGroupPainter`, which coordinates the
/// rendering of marker groups as part of the chart's visualization pipeline.
abstract class MarkerGroupIconPainter extends MarkerIconPainter {
  /// Paints single marker on the canvas
  /// Overrides the parent class method with an empty implementation.
  ///
  /// This method is intentionally left empty because `MarkerGroupIconPainter` and its
  /// subclasses focus on painting groups of markers rather than individual markers.
  /// The actual painting logic is implemented in the `paintMarkerGroup` method.
  ///
  /// While this method is required by the parent class interface, it's not used in
  /// the context of group painters. Instead, the `paintMarkerGroup` method is called
  /// by the `MarkerGroupPainter` class to render groups of markers.
  ///
  /// @param canvas The canvas on which to paint.
  /// @param center The center position of the marker.
  /// @param anchor The anchor position of the marker.
